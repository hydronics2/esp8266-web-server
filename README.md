# esp8266-web-server
the smallest lua web server serving an html page with javascript

This code was developed from this helpful example page: http://www.magusporta.com/projects/ESP8266_web_server/ESP8266_web_server.html

Even though there is no internet connection on the ESP, your phone or computer typically caches the .js files so it seems to work; such as, <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script>
